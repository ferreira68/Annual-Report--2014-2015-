Team}\index{Courses}\index{Workshops}

This past year we hosted our first HPC Symposium, which exceeded our
expectations in both attendance and interest.  We plan to expand the symposium
to a two day event for the Fall of 2015.  In addition, we hosted Joost
VandeVondele (ETH Zurich) for a CP2K workshop.  This event was very
well-attended and included participants from the Army Research Laboratory as
well as a large contingent from the University of Pittsburgh community.  Our Consultants provided training in MPI and Python programming and organized a
two-day training session on the Intel Xeon Phi architecture, which was
presented by trainers from Colfax International.

The Consultants also leveraged the many opportunities to enhance the
computational skill sets of our students by providing guest lectures in several
Engineering and Biological Sciences courses.

Furthermore, hands-on training workshops were provided to new users of the HPC
cluster during the beginning of the Fall 2014 and Spring 2015 semesters.  We
revived the Brown Bag Lunch seminars as well.  All of these coordinated
efforts align with the Center's education mission to elevate the broader
computational expertise of students and researchers within the Pitt community.
