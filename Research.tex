\section{Funding}\index{Funding}
\subsection{Direct SaM Participation}
\begin{itemize}
   \item Through the efforts of Esteban Meneses and Antonio Ferreira, SaM renewed our certification as a CUDA Research Center based on ``the vision,
quality, and impact of [our] research leveraging CUDA technology.''  This ensures our continued relationship with NVIDIA, a company with strong ties to national supercomputing centers.
\end{itemize}
