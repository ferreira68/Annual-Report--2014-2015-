\section{Faculty Recruiting}
The Center assisted in the recruitment of two new computational faculty
for the School of Medicine: Vaughn Cooper (MMG) and Miller Lee (Biology).
We were involved in discussions of computing infrastructure early in the 
process and were able to provide input to the departments with respect to
computing costs for startup packages.
