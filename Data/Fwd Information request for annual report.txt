Subject: Information request for annual report 
 

If you have not already done so, please send me the citation(s) for any publications that you have from last 
year that were facilitated by your use of the resources from the Center for Simulation and Modeling.  In 
addition, please send the title and annual dollar amount for any grants that you have where you utilized the 
Center for ongoing research.  We are requesting this information for inclusion in our annual report (for internal 
use only).  We would also appreciate it if you could forward this information as soon as possible.  Please let me 
know if you don't have anything to report this year should that be the case.
 
Thank you for your assistance. 
 
 Best regards,
 Wendy Janocha
